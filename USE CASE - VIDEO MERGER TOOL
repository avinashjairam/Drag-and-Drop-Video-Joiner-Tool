USE CASE - VIDEO MERGER TOOL 

User uploads a series of videos. These are stored in a folder named after his session. This folder is created when he uploads his first video. After each video is uploaded, a sortable bar
from the JQuery UI is created and the name of the video appears in that bar. 

The user then drags and rearranges the video in any order he wants. 

When the user hits the merge button, the order of the sortable bars is noted. This information is fed to a shell script. The shell script then executes and merges the videos. 

A download link appears prompting the user to download the video. The merged video is also played below.
